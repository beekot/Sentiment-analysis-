Sentiment Analysis of covid 19 vaccine related Tweets
Tweets regarding the COVID-19 vaccine are retrieved from Twitter using Tweepy. After gathering those tweets, they are preprocessed, labeled with sentiments, and then finally, models are created. The models are created using machine learning and deep learning algorithms-classifiers. Using the models will help to discern the real emotions of those tweeting about the COVID-19 vaccine. The tweets gathered by Tweepy were labeled using TextBlob and Vader, then tested with unigram, bigram, and 4-gram features. After viewing our results and comparing the different models, we noticed the classifier trained using a deep learning algorithm showed the highest accuracy.
